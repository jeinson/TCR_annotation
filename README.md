# TCR annotation with Gapped Alignment
Scripts for G4771 Computational Genomics

These jupyter notebooks are run with an R kernel, and give a snapshot of the work that I did for a course at Columbia, Computational Genomics, Spring 2018

The included files are:

1.) Sample Alignment Script.ipynb. This notebook illustrates how alignment to the VDJdb is performed. I only give five samples in the demo, but when I ran all 191 samples, I used a Google Cloud VM

2.) Cleaned Alignment Results.ipynb. This notebook shows some of the analyses I did on the processed files. 

To run, the library `Biostrings` and `tidyerse` are required. Scripts were tested on R version 3.4.2
